# Project 3: MERN-Stack Workout App :muscle:

# About the App:
Exercising is crucial in keeping the mind and body healthy. However, for many, motivating oneself to actually getting up and moving the body can be difficult (even for myself). Sometimes we want to work out so badly but don't know where to begin. What types of exercises should I do? Should I include weights? If so, how heavy? Should I count a certain amount of reps? This app is here to take a bit of that stress away.

In this app, you can create your own workout -- to however many (or little) exercises you want. Scroll through different exercise options, add them to your workout for the day, then track your workout with a timer. You can delete a workout if you ended up not liking it, too.

## Next Steps
This is a project I plan on adding lots to and really amping up. To name a couple, some of my future goals for this app include creating a calendar to show which days you created your workouts on. Additionally, I'd like to graph that data to add as an extra visual to help the user see patterns of their workout routines, and hopefully influence future workouts. I also plan on spending more time on the styling of this app.
